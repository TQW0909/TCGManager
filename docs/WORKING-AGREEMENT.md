# Working Agreement (Luffy as PM/Lead)

## How we work
- I will drive the backlog, break work into tickets, and implement changes in small PR-sized commits.
- You (Ting) can approve direction and answer product questions quickly.
- We optimize for a working tool you can actually use for Whatnot.

## Definition of done
- Feature works end-to-end against Supabase.
- Basic validation and UX to prevent obvious bad data (negative qty, overselling lots).
- Minimal docs (how to run locally + any setup).

## Inputs I need from Ting
- Supabase project URL + anon key for local dev.
- Any Whatnot fee/shipping assumptions you want as defaults.
- Your preferred workflow: order-level tracking vs stream-level tracking.
